## ZIP code API consume
Here i did a simple zipcode api consume in java using "jackson" library.  
Made a request with the zipcode and returned the Street information. 

### What i learned
- API Consume in Java.
- Depedency injection for using "jackson" library.
- Using postman for API testing.

### Sinopse
I'll use this repo to create more projects of REST API usage.  
I intend to improve this project and scale it to something bigger.
